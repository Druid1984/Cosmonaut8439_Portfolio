### How It Was Built

This paragraph explains the steps involved in building your portfolio.

1. **Setup Repository:**
    * Created a new repository with the same name as my GitHub username.
    * Initialized the repository with a README file.

2. **Project Structure:** (Explain your project structure here)
3. ```
my-nextjs-project/
│
├── pages/
│   ├── api/
│   │   └── hello.js
│   ├── _app.js
│   └── index.js
│
├── public/
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   └── vercel.svg
│
├── styles/
│   ├── globals.css
│   └── Home.module.css
│
├── components/
│   ├── Header.js
│   └── Footer.js
│
├── lib/
│   └── utils.js
│
├── .eslintrc.json
├── .gitignore
├── next.config.js
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

This structure represents a typical Next.js project setup, including:

- `pages/`: Contains your application's pages and API routes
- `public/`: Stores static assets like images
- `styles/`: Houses your CSS files
- `components/`: For reusable React components
- `lib/`: Utility functions and shared code
- Configuration files for Next.js, ESLint, etc.

4. **Customization:**
    * Customized the README file using GitHub Flavored Markdown to include personal details, skills, and project links.
    * Used [Magic UI](https://magicui.design/docs/components/icon-cloud) to display my skill sets.

#### Example Code Snippet

Here's a code snippet showing how Magic UI was used to display skill sets:

```jsx
// This is a code block
const slugs = [
  "html5",
  "css3",
  "javascript",
  "typescript",
  "nodedotjs",
  "react",
  "angular",
  "vuedotjs",
  "tailwindcss",
  "nextdotjs",
  "redux",
  "webpack",
  "git",
  "jest",
  "bootstrap",
  "vercel",
  "ocaml",
  "python",
  "grunt",
  "gulp",
  "p5dotjs",
  "Java",
  "Github",
  "Dart",
  "css3",
  "Docker",
  "Figma",
];

const Skills = () => {
  const { theme } = useTheme();
  // Rest of the component code
};

Many thanks to Harris Johnsen for making this React portfolio open source. I have modified it slightly to include information about myself and the technologies used.
