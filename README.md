### How It Was Built

This paragraph explains the steps involved in building your portfolio.

1. **Setup Repository:**
    * Created a new repository with the same name as my GitHub username.
    * Initialized the repository with a README file.

2. **Project Structure:** (Explain your project structure here)

3. **Customization:**
    * Customized the README file using GitHub Flavored Markdown to include personal details, skills, and project links.
    * Used [Magic UI](https://magicui.design/docs/components/icon-cloud) to display my skill sets.

#### Example Code Snippet

Here's a code snippet showing how Magic UI was used to display skill sets:

```jsx
// This is a code block
const slugs = [

  "javascript",
  "typescript",
  "nodedotjs",
  "react",
  "angular",
  "vuedotjs",
  "tailwindcss",
  "nextdotjs",
  "redux",
  "webpack",
  "git",
  "jest",
  "bootstrap",

  "grunt",
  "gulp",
  "p5dotjs",
  "Java",
  "Github",

];

const Skills = () => {
  const { theme } = useTheme();
  // Rest of the component code
};
